Creation. We do stuff. For two reasons:

 - because it's fun
 - because we can

Thats the spirit behind T.V.K. the versatile webservices provider with Kolinahr.

Kolinahr (ko-li-naar), as a word, described both the Vulcan ritual by which all remaining vestigial emotions were demonstrated as purged, and the mental discipline whereby this state was subsequently maintained.

Let's not be weeny about it and include the standard Jekyll highlighted code snippet:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
