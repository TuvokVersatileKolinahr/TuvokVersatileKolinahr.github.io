You might be wondering what this little intern we had here, Asok we call him, is up to these days. After creating https://github.com/TuvokVersatileKolinahr/asok-frontend and the https://github.com/TuvokVersatileKolinahr/asok-backend he went on with a next project which is stinn in an inception phase. We haven't heard from him in about two years and quite frankly don't know if he's still in his cubicle or not.

But hey, why worry?
